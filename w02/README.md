# week 02

For this week's classwork, I have decided to use Xournal++ instead of OneNote
since it's better at exporting things to pdfs. Apparently it wasn't this time,
though, so I exported it to a png. For the first time, I got to use
desmos-offline for my math class. Finally I can add my desmos graphs to version
control!
